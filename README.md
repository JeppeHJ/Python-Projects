## Birthday Wisher

A simple Python script that sends birthday wishes to your friends via email. It reads the list of friends and their birthdates from a CSV file and sends a personalized email when it's their birthday.

## Coffee Machine OOP

An object-oriented implementation of a coffee machine simulator. Users can choose different types of coffee, and the program calculates the required ingredients and the cost.

## Flash Card Game

A flashcard-style game for learning and memorizing new facts. The game displays questions and answers, and the user can reveal the answer by clicking on the card.

## ISS Overhead Check

A Python script that checks if the International Space Station (ISS) is currently visible overhead. It uses an API to get the ISS's current location and compares it with the user's coordinates.

## Kanye Quotes

A fun Python program that generates random quotes from Kanye West using an API. Users can click a button to display new quotes.

## NATO Alphabet

A Python script that converts a given word or phrase into the NATO phonetic alphabet. The program reads the NATO alphabet from a CSV file and converts the input accordingly.

## Password Manager

A password manager application that allows users to store and manage their passwords securely. The application uses encryption to protect the stored passwords and can generate strong, random passwords.

## Pomodoro

A Python-based Pomodoro timer that helps users manage their work and break times. The timer counts down the work and break intervals, and an alarm sounds when each interval is over.

## Pong Game

A Python implementation of the classic Pong game using the Turtle module. Players can control the paddles and try to score points by hitting the ball.

## Quiz Game OOP

An object-oriented quiz game that tests users' general knowledge. The game fetches questions from an API, and players must answer them within a certain time limit.

## Rain Alerter

A Python script that sends an SMS alert if rain is expected in the user's location. The program uses weather APIs to check the forecast and sends a text message using a third-party SMS service.

## Snake Game

A Python version of the classic Snake game using the Pygame library. Users can control the snake and try to eat food while avoiding collisions with the snake's body and the game's boundaries.

## Turtle Crossing Game

A Python game inspired by the classic Frogger game. Players must guide a turtle across a busy road while avoiding collisions with moving cars.

## US States Game

A quiz game that tests users' knowledge of US states. Players must identify and enter the names of all 50 states, and the game tracks the correct answers and provides feedback. The game uses the Turtle module to display a map of the United States and place the state names in their correct locations.
